# Experiment 3: Python Data Analysis (Pandas)

_This is the third of several repositories I will upload to document my progress in Python programming through several exercises I am and will be performing. In this project, I am expected to identify the codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library._

## Description/Given Problems
#### PROBLEM 1: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P1.py 
Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations: 
- Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
- Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars. 
#### PROBLEM 2: Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P2.py 
Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and indexing operations. 
- Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7…) of cars. 
- Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’. 
- How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have? 
- Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Anaconda Navigator ver. 2.6.0 or later
* Jupyter Notebook ver. 7.0.8 or later
* Any form of OS (Windows/Mac) that supports running the above software and Python code

### Supplementary File
* 'cars.csv' - Dataframe
* 'Magracia_Pandas-P1.py' - Problem 1 code
* 'Magracia_Pandas-P2.py' - Problem 2 code

### Program Execution
* To successfully run both program files, select a specific cell and press Shift + Enter.
* To use the Pandas library, it must be imported in both codes using 'import pandas as pd'.
* Store the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas attribute 'read_csv'.
